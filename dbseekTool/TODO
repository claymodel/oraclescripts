- wrapper script: use $1 as ORACLE_SID

- on sql errors: retrieve exact error position and display it

- implement \e

- implement \something for
  * grants

- re-invent the whole lexing, possibly with yacc
  (current parsing has a lot of subtle holes)

- make it work with non-tty stdin

- tab completion (maybe read table names, dictionary at start?)

- check / fix handling of SIGSTOP

- [done] save multiline history entries correctly
